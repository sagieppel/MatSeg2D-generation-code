# MatSeg2D-generation-code
Generation code for the MatSeg 2D using patterns infusion.
Use this code to generate the MatSeg 2D dataset described in [Learning Zero-Shot Material States Segmentation, by
Implanting Natural Image Patterns in Synthetic Data](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.03309).

For the MatSeg dataset see [1](https://zenodo.org/records/11331618](https://sites.google.com/view/matseg) or [2](https://zenodo.org/records/11331618)

For running the code see: Generate_2D_Scene_And_Annotation.py main section.

The script should run as is with the sampled folders supplied.

Was run on standart i7 cpu with no special hardware.
